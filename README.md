## 6. Discussion about User Interface
The following pages/features were implemented in the project:

- **Product page**: A page where item details like item title, category short and long description, high quality image and item price. In addition, it contains a call to action button "Add to Cart", this user can simply add the products to the cart after selecting the quantity needed for sure.
- **Shopping cart**: A page that contains the products added to client's cart, where the client may be a guest user or already registered user. A number of rows rendered with details of the cart items, options like delete, increase, decrease the quantity already provided to the client. A call to action "Proceed to Checkout" is added.

## 7. Conclusions
In summary, I have implemented successfully an ecommerce web store with basic functionalities to enable smoother and great user experience using different tools and technologies basically, React, TailwindCSS, PHP and MySQL for database. The project has different features through shopping flow from add to cart up to post and fetch data from and to the database. I developed the pagination to enable smooth interaction between pages and avoid rendering the same page different times which is time-consuming for the user. For security, I enabled the hashing password using SH1 algorithm and protected the store from SQL injection.
